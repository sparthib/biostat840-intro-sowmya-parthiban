    "text": "I was born in the Bay Area, California and grew up in India. I did my undergrad in UC San Diego where I majored in Cognitive Science, but also studied a great deal of world history. Before joining the Ph.D. program, I did my masters in BME at the Homewood campus. I have an interest in brain disorders and applying statistical/machine learning methods on transcriptomics data in order to understand them better. I like to solve mini crossword puzzles on NYT, and go salsa/swing dancing in my free time."
